The website offers a user-friendly solution for people who work with image files and need to rename and manage them more efficiently

Batch Renaming: 
  When users have a collection of image files with generic or unclear filenames, it can be time-consuming to rename each file individually. This website allows users to upload multiple images at once and apply a common prefix and postfix to all of them. For example, they can add "Vacation_0000" to each image's filename
Customize File Naming: 
  Users can enter a prefix and postfix of their choice, and they have the option to specify the number of digits in the renaming format. For example, they can choose to rename files with a format like prefix0000postfix.png, prefix0001postfix.png, and so on. The default is set to 4 digits.
ZIP Download: 
  After renaming the images, the website compiles them into a ZIP archive. This simplifies the process of downloading the images in one bundle. Users can quickly obtain the entire collection with a single click, saving time and effort.
